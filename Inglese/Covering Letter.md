With the [[CVS]] we need a strong cover letter for getting our CV noticed by employers. We have to:

- **Personalize each letter:** Avoid generic letters! Tailor your content to the specific job and company.
- **Add additional details**
- **Maintain formality:** Use professional language, proper greetings, and closings based on familiarity.
- **Structure your content:** Divide your letter into clear paragraphs following a specific format:
    - **First paragraph:** Introduce yourself, state the job you're applying for, and mention where you saw the advertisement (including reference number if present).
    - **Main body (2-3 paragraphs):** Explain your motivation and emphasize how your qualifications align with the job requirements. Be concise, as the CV provides further details.
    - **Closing paragraph:** Thank the reader, express interview availability, and hope to be contacted soon.
